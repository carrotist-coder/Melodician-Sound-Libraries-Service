# Sound-Libraries-Service
You're watching the Online Sound Libraries Service Startup!

My startup is to create an online service for musicians that will provide free access to high-quality sound libraries for creating musical compositions. Using this service, every musician can find sounds/samples by category (sound type, genre, tonality, tempo, etc.) and use them in their projects without fear that they violate copyrights or are of poor quality. My goal is to make the process of creating music more accessible and convenient for all creative people.

1. Subject area: music area

2. Problems in the area:
•	A limited number of high-quality sounds/samples without copyright on the Internet for writing musical compositions
•	Limited access to high-quality sound libraries
•	Lack of services for publishing their own music libraries
•	A huge number of low-quality sounds which are freely available on the Internet, the use of which worsens musical compositions and complicates the process of writing music
•	Existing resources offer a very limited selection of sounds or require a paid subscription, which may not be acceptable for musicians and those who work with a limited budget

3. Problem solving methods
•	Development and provision of an extensive library of free sounds without copyright for musicians by category (by type, by genre, by tonality, by tempo, etc.)
•	Enabling musicians to download and publish their music libraries/archives with sounds/samples
•	The ability to create music accounts and host your own music libraries
•	Providing convenient tools for searching and filtering sounds by category
•	Careful selection and quality control of sounds/samples uploaded to the service (through moderation)

# Alternative ideas for a startup:
1. Search for musical compositions by the entered notes or tune. Many people memorize fragments of musical compositions by ear, but they do not know or do not remember the name of a particular musical composition. Through voice input, my application/service determines the notes and uses them to search for notes in the database of music tracks. The notes will be recognized using a neural network. Also, the search can be carried out by writing notes with a "sheet music", then the user's entered data will participate in the search – specific notes with certain durations.

2. The program that makes up the menu / diet for the day according to the calories and products in the refrigerator, preferences. Existing programs that have the function of compiling a diet for the day, most often provide only one or several menu options. My program will give out a large number of varieties of menus with selected products and calories.

3. A mobile application that shows ads for large retail chains, stores nearby. Businesses buy space in the app and place their ads there. Application users passing near a shopping center receive a notification advertising a shopping business/facility/enterprise. For each view of such advertising (unobtrusive, up to 5 seconds), the user receives 1 virtual point. And for a certain number of points (for example, 30 points), the user can get a discount on goods or participate in promotions. Thus, users have discounts and they benefit, and shopping centers attract more visitors and customers, inform about upcoming promotions.
