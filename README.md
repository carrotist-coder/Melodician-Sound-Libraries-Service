<h1>Melodician: Sound Libraries Service</h1>
Welcome to the <b>Melodician: Online Sound Libraries Service Startup!</b>
<br>
<br>
My startup is to create an online service for musicians that will provide free access to high-quality sound libraries for creating musical compositions. Using this service, every musician can find sounds/samples by category (sound type, genre, tonality, tempo, etc.) and use them in their projects without fear that they violate copyrights or are of poor quality. My goal is to make the process of creating music more accessible and convenient for all creative people.

<h2>Description</h2>
This online service provides you free access to high-quality sound libraries for creating musical compositions. It has a huge database of sounds which are uploaded by users. The service has a main tab, which contains a collection of free sound libraries sorted by categories. Every registered user of my service can download sound archives/libraries without copyright for free. The user can also use the sound filter by various categories in order to find necessary sounds. Users can also upload and share their own sound libraries. All published sounds are thoroughly checked (with the help of moderation), and after approval they become verified.
